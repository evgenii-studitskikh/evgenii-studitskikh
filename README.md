**My routine:** 
- 🥷🏻 Building client applications architecture and design patterns (React, Angular);
- 🦠 BD architecture design (MySQL), RESTful API implementation (PHP Phalcon framework), Node.js server, Redis, HLS, Socket.io, RabbitMQ;
- 🥲 Experience with Solidity, NFTs, Web3, ERC-20, ERC-721, and other Dapps technologies;
